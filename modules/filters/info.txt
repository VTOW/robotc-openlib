# Filters:

## Biquad Filter: 
 - Best used for filtering gyroscope/accelerometer data.
 - int BiquadFilterInit(...) initializes the filter
   - `type` can be either LOWPASS or HIGHPASS 
   - `sampleFreq` is the sampling frequency. Ex. 100 if sampling 100 times a second.
   - `cutoffFreq` is the -3db frequency for the filter.  
   - `defaultValue` is the first value to be saved into the filter.  Default to 0.
   - NOTE: samplingFreq should not be less then the cutoffFreq.
 - float BiquadFilterSample(...) takes a sample and returns a filtered value.
